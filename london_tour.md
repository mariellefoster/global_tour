London Recommendations:
(Always check price before booking, these vary)

From Eric Hambro

Kiln - incredible not at all authentic thai.  great loud but small. sharing plates. Go with a friend. Funky wine. One of my favourites in london

Lorne - shut until mid august due to flooding. Pimlico v near me. Great set menu for lunch but mainly great vibe, small and excellent wine list. Friendly. Talk to the sommelier who owns it Kate exton for wine reccs. Check whether it's open. I go by myself.

Anglo - 70 quid 8 course is all they do. Great splash out incredible pairings, "english cuisine" done interesting.

Som saa - Whitechapel/spitalfoelds aldgate. Good to get rowdy with mates. Killer thai again hope you like spice. Great for a night out

Mangal 2 - dalston. Secret gem Turkish resto is a good cheap way before might out

Gunpowder - shoreditch aslo, but back on to interesting cooking. Indian food with interesting twists. Fair price. Have the whole cauliflower.

Two more - blowouts

1) restaurant stories - one michelin star, incredible tasting menu. Transportatve. Iv never experience a culinary experience like that. 200 quid. Go with someone who you will be as enthused as you to be paying that amount. Maybe not for this trip, but anther trip to london with A romantic partner

2) Portland - incredible restaurant, less pricey but still pricey. "English" cooking with phenomenal wine list. O was blown away. But was taken by girlfriends parents. Estimate 90 a head if you're doing wine, 2/3 courses

Also good blowouts: chiltern firehouse - go with your most glam friend, the food is incredible but it's a haunt for celebs. I've been twice (always special occasions never paying) and seen a few.

A Wong - used to be local cheap Chinese take away growing up! Then the kid took over, went to Hong Kong trained as a chef and reopened! It got a Michelin bib gourmand, but that got upgraded to a star last year! Surreal since I remember it before. Vv good but now they've adjusted their prices accordingly :(

I would say go to anglo or kiln before leaving the UK for something to talk about. Anglo if you want a great food experience, kiln if you want to recommend the new hotness.
